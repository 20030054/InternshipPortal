# Decisions

Append-only. Never edit or delete a past entry — if a decision is reversed,
add a new entry that says so and links back to the one it supersedes. Newest

### D-001 — 2026-08-30 — Docs-only first session, no application code

**Decision:** Session 1 creates only the `/docs` skeleton (`PROGRESS.md`,
`CONVENTIONS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`modules/M00.md`, `modules/M01.md`). No Dockerfile, no `package.json`, no
source code.

**Why:** `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §13 explicitly says "Do not write application
code yet" for the first session, and §0.2 mandates one module per session.
Writing code before M00 has a spec would violate both.

### D-002 — 2026-08-30 — Single-app repo layout, not a workspace monorepo

**Decision:** One Next.js application at the repo root (`/src`, `/prisma`,
`/tests`), not a pnpm/turborepo workspace with separate packages.

**Why:** There is exactly one deployable unit (the `app` image; `worker` is
the same image with a different start command per §8.1). A workspace tool
buys nothing here and adds config surface a small team would have to
maintain. If a genuinely separate package emerges later (e.g. a shared
types package consumed by something outside this repo), revisit.

---

### D-003 — 2026-08-30 — pnpm as package manager

**Decision:** Use pnpm for dependency management and scripts.

**Why:** Strict node_modules resolution catches phantom dependencies early,
faster CI installs via its content-addressable store, single lockfile. Not
mandated by `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §6 (which is silent on package manager); this
is a build-tooling choice within the stack it does specify.

---

### D-004 — 2026-08-30 — Capabilities named as `verb.object` strings, not role checks

**Decision:** The authority matrix (`src/server/authz/matrix.ts`, to be
built in M02) is keyed by capability strings like `offer.approve`,
`grade.award`, `restart.countersign`, never by role name in calling code.

**Why:** `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §2 and §3 are explicit that authority is
"enumerated, not inherited" and that a route checks a capability, not a
role — this makes that structurally hard to violate, since there is no
`if (role === 'FOCAL')` pattern available to reach for.

---

### D-005 — 2026-08-30 — Conventional commits, one module's work per commit series

**Decision:** Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
(`feat(m05): ...`), and a module's implementation lands as one commit or a
short series that corresponds to the `/docs/PROGRESS.md` "Completed
modules" checkbox flipping.

**Why:** Makes `git log` a second, cheaper index into what happened per
module without needing to re-read `PROGRESS_ARCHIVE.md`, consistent with
the token-discipline goal in §0.2.

---

### D-006 — 2026-08-30 — Dependencies pinned to exact patch versions, not ranges

**Decision:** `package.json` pins every dependency to an exact resolved
version (`"next": "15.5.24"`, not `"^15.5.24"`), matched by
`pnpm-lock.yaml`.

**Why:** A university team maintaining this for years benefits more from
"upgrades are a deliberate, reviewed action" than from automatically
absorbing patch releases. Combined with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in
both CI and the Dockerfile's `deps` stage, this means the exact same
dependency tree is built in dev, CI and production every time, with no
"works on my machine" gap from a minor version drifting between them.

---

### D-007 — 2026-08-30 — `pg` and `ioredis` used directly for M00's readiness probe

**Decision:** `/api/ready` (`src/server/health/checks.ts`) connects with
`pg`'s `Client` and `ioredis` directly, rather than waiting for Prisma
(M01) or BullMQ (M12) to exist.

**Why:** M00 has no schema and no job queue yet — a readiness probe only
needs to prove the database and Redis are reachable, which is exactly what
these two libraries do at their lowest level, with no dependency on
anything M01/M12 will introduce. Both `pg` and `ioredis` are already
committed in `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §6.1 (`ioredis` as BullMQ's transitive
dependency, `pg` implicitly via Prisma's Postgres driver), so this isn't a
new addition to the stack, just an early direct use of a library the stack
already requires.

---

### D-008 — 2026-08-30 — Worker healthcheck is a heartbeat file, not the app's HTTP probe

**Decision:** The `worker` compose service overrides the image's inherited
`HEALTHCHECK` (which probes `GET /api/health` on port 3000) with a check
that reads the mtime of `/tmp/healthy`, a file `worker/index.mjs` touches
every 15 seconds.

**Why:** `worker` never opens an HTTP port — reusing the app's HTTP
healthcheck would always fail. A heartbeat file is the simplest signal that
survives the rewrite to a real BullMQ `Worker` in M12 (a stalled event loop
stops writing the file and the container is correctly reported unhealthy).

---

### D-009 — 2026-08-30 — `next-env.d.ts` and `*.tsbuildinfo` are gitignored

**Decision:** Both are excluded from version control, matching current
`create-next-app` convention (older Next.js starters committed
`next-env.d.ts`; current ones don't).

**Why:** `next-env.d.ts` is regenerated by `next dev`/`next build` on every
run and carries no information beyond a couple of `/// <reference>` lines;
committing it just invites merge noise. `*.tsbuildinfo` is `tsc`'s
incremental-build cache — pure derived state, machine-specific, safe to
delete anytime.
